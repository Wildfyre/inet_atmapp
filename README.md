ATM client-server exercise
==========================

This is my program for an exercise at KTH course DD1361: Programming Paradigms. The course information and assignment can be found [here](http://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kth/kurser/DD1361/). For an explanation of what's what, have a look at [the transfer protocol](/./AtmProtocol.md).

This is neither polished code or a recommended solution to the exercise. Questions are best sent by mail, see [erlindst.se](www.erlindst.se).
